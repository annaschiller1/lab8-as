### Column Graph of texas Oil Spills

```{r}

oils_spills<- read_csv("oil_spills.csv") # can use this read_csv instead of read.csv because we have downloaded tidyverse, this reads it as a table dF?

df<- oils_spills %>% 
  filter(`Accident State` == "TX" & `Accident Year`<2017) %>%  # if there's a space in your column
  group_by(`Accident Year`) %>% 
  summarise( Loss = sum(`Net Loss (Barrels)`)) #creates new column that summarizes

colnames(df) <- c("Year", "Loss")

ggplot(df, aes(x=Year, y= Loss)) +
  geom_col()

```
